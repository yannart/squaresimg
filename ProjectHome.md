With a main image and some little images, the software can generate a new image where the colour of the little images is modified to map the main image.
The main image can have the size you want. This is also true for little images but they need to have the same size.
The program is internationalized and for now supports English, French and Spanish languages.
The project is make in full Java 1.5 language using swing and JAI libraries.
Several image formats are supported for reading and writing.
There are several options to change how the little images are coloured.

The sources are available as a NetBeans project.
